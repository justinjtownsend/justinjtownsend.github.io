# justinjtownsend.github.io

Items you find in here have largely come from my experience, but they were / are real-world challenges needing some automation / coding to resolve.

To the extent these solutions are derived from my own experiences, they are opinionated. Nevertheless, they were tested and working at the time of their use and so I share them here that they inspire the thinking of others.

At one stage I wrote a blog, see [here](https://dr-obi.blogspot.com/), but have found this approach from GitHub to be more direct for my purposes.

Code in this repo is provided 'as-is' and is not actively maintained.
